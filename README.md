# Evaluation of the Mutation Testing Approaches Used in Mutatest and MutPy on Open-Source Python Programs
## Mutation Testing of Open Source Projects in Python
CS 514: Software Product and Process Evaluation Term Project

### Table of Contents:

RESULTS Folder: This folder contains all of the results/data collected throughout the experiment.
  - Coverage: All Coverage Files. The Statement Coverage Percentage of each test suite was calculated from each of these files.
  - Failed: Failed runs of projects that data were collected on. Often projects that were used in initial data collection that simply didn't work.
  - Mutation: All FINAL Mutation Results. Contains all 72 data files (6 projects x 6 test suites x 2 mutation testing tools) used in data analysis.
  - All Other Folders: Named by the computer where the data was collected. All Final Mutation Results came from Boise.

README.md: This file.

directoryScript.py: This is the script that was used on the 5 open-source projects to subset the large test suites that were provided with each open-source project.

directorScript_PA1.py: This is the script that was used on the Python program from CS220: Discrete Structures and their Applications to subset the test suite that I wrote at the beginning of this project.
